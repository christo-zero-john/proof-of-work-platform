Talking devpost as example. I want to create a platform where anyone could submit their proof of works. All the works are opensource, which means it should provide all files so that others could work on them. The asset, live links are given. If the work is an installable package they should submit package link intead of live link. The platform is not for developers or designers, but for every type of people in the world. If thir is a way to showcase their proof of work they should be able to showcase it in this platform. Also if someone wants to create based on someone elses work, they could create a fork of that project and submit their proof of work as a project. Fork means, there will be a link saying the work is a varieant or new version of the parent work. Brainstorm on this idea.

## Project Planning

### Project Title
**ProofHub** – The Global Proof-of-Work Sharing Platform

### Overview
ProofHub is a universal, open-source proof-of-work sharing platform where individuals from any field can submit their projects by linking to assets, live demos, code repositories, documents, and more. ProofHub does not host assets but facilitates access by accepting only links to externally hosted files, documents, or packages. It encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration and allows users to “fork” or create variations of existing works, fostering innovation and creative evolution. ProofHub is designed to support creators from every domain, allowing them to showcase their contributions, gain inspiration, and build upon each other’s ideas.

### Key Features
1. **Submission System**: Users can submit projects with links to assets (e.g., GitHub for code, Google Drive for documents, Behance for designs).
2. **Forking Mechanism**: Users can create "forks" of projects, linked to the original work, to show variations or derived versions, enabling collaboration.
3. **Attribution and Lineage Tracking**: Every fork or variation retains attribution to the original creator, creating a visual lineage of iterations.
4. **Support for All Content Types**: ProofHub is category-agnostic, supporting all fields from art to engineering to scientific research.
5. **Category-Based Organization**: Projects are categorized and tagged, making it easy to discover works in areas such as Art, Software, Writing, Science, Music, and more.
6. **User Profiles and Portfolios**: Each user has a public profile that showcases their original works, forks, and collaborations.
7. **Discoverability and Search Tools**: Comprehensive filtering and search functionality allow users to explore based on categories, tags, popularity, and recent forks.
8. **Collaborator System**: Users can request to collaborate on projects and contribute to existing work as team members.

### Goals
- **Foster a Collaborative Community**: Encourage open collaboration across disciplines, fostering innovation and knowledge sharing.
- **Enable Transparent Attribution**: Maintain attribution for original creators while allowing their work to be expanded upon.
- **Simplify Proof-of-Work Sharing**: Make it easy for users to showcase and access work without requiring asset uploads, simplifying submission and reducing server load.
